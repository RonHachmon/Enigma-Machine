# Enigma machine

this code implement the ecryption enigme machine :shipit:

## Machine Features

### 1. Setting
The first page of the program allows you to adjust the Enigma rotors you wish to include and their order,
as well as setting switch characters for the machine (such as A = R, etc.).

### 2. Encyption/Decryption
On this page, you can encrypt and decrypt your text by resetting the machine and encrypting the decrypted message.

### 3. Brute force encyption
The program offers a brute force decryption feature, which allows you to select words from the dictionary and let the computer perform the decryption.
You can set the difficulty level, which determines the number of permutations available, 
and adjust the number of agents to increase or decrease the number of threads the PC will utilize to solve the decryption.
Each thread works on a different permutation.
